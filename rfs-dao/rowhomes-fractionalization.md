# Rowhomes Fractionalization

Following the initial sale, we will start Rowhome fractionalization attempts, so what is present in this page might change in the future.

Fractionalization could be done by creating a NFTX vault with a small amount of Rowhomes NFTs. After some thinking we decided to settle for 500 fractions per Rowhome, under the token name ROWHOME.

**500 ROWHOME = 1 ROWHOME NFT**

This NFTX vault will also allow any Rowhome NFT holder to instantly buy and sell any Rowhome if they wish, paying or receiving the proportional amount of ETH backing 500 fractions at any time.

We hope other Rowhome long-term holders stake Rowhome NFTs in this vault as well, to mint more ROWHOME and decrease slippage. This will incentivize more people to hold ROWHOME, increase traction in the DeFi space and also increase the collectionâ€™s floor price overtime.

Note that staking in the vault will get you 500 ROWHOME but you might lose access to the original NFT if someone else buys it. This mechanism makes swapping Rowhomes possible.

The ROWHOME fraction token could be listed in SushiSwap and will let small investors, not only DAO members, to own a part of Rowhomes.

Follow up actions:

* Make ROWHOME eligible for SUSHI rewards in the future.
* Make Staking in NFTX eligible for NFTX rewards in the future.
