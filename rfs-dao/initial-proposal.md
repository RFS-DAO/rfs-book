# Initial Proposal

## Goals

* Allow people to chip in to buy NFTs, particularly Rowhomes. We fully believe that Rowhomes will continue to appreciate in price leaving smaller investors unable to own a single Rowhome NFT.&#x20;
* Support the current collection, either by creating awareness, promotion and information sharing with collectors and members of the DAO.
* Study and plan future DeFi integrations with Rowhome NFTs. We aim to speed asset appreciation and generate passive income for all DAO members.

## The Rowhome Floor Sweepers (RFS) Token

* Token name: RFS
* Token type: ERC 20
* Supply: 25000
* Starting price: 1 ETH

The RFS DAO sets the initial price of 1 ETH. DAO members are free to put RFS in trading protocols to allow trading and others to enter the RFS DAO.

This initial starting price makes it easy to track performance against ETH. Subsequent sales might have the price change as the DAOâ€™s assets increase or decrease in value, along with the free market value of RFS.

There is no periodic release schedule and all subsequent sales will be considered after community vote and snapshot. Member voting snapshots will be based on circulating RFS, not on what the DAO holds. Final decision rests on multisig, as to prevent possible Sybil attacks and inside trading.

## Initial Seed Sale

Sale total: 35 ETH (or open ended)

RFS to release in circulation: 35 RFS

Sale type: contract transfer

Minimum buy: none

Maximum buy: none

Buy order: FCFS

This sale should be enough to start sweeping the floor. If the sale total is quickly achieved we will start planning a next bigger sale.

## Member Benefits

* Anyone can be a member by simply holding the RFS ERC20 token.
* Proportional voting power relative to the amount of RFS you hold.
* RFS token appreciation, as NFTs within the DAO increase in value.
* Rewards, as the DAO creates partnerships, generates DeFi income and receives possible future NFT airdrops.
* Access to a private Discord channel.
